What are we going to call this thing?

----Cosmic Whistle Software Radio-----

The reason I thought to use cosmic whistle was due to this article:

"Cosmic Whistle" Packs a Surprisingly Energetic Punch http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2016-news/Fox11-2016

I'm thinking of a name that would state "hey this is the radio of the future"! To show the public this is using radio in the most progressive way!
